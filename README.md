### Clinical Diagnosis Support with Convolution Neural Network by Transfer Learning  
  
**Abstract** Breast cancer is extremely prevalent among women in the United States. Breast cancer screening is common but requires a radiologist to review screening images to make a diagnosis. Diagnosis through the traditional screening method of mammography currently have an accuracy of about 78%. A more recent and precise technique called digital breast tomosynthesis has shown to be more promising. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), are very well suited for image classification techniques. A machine learning model has the potential to not only improve the accuracy of current breast cancer screening, but also decrease reduce the time it takes to diagnose a patient, leading to faster treatment. In this study, a CNN was trained on an open-source dataset from Duke of DBT images belonging to patients with no tumors, benign tumors, and malignant tumors. Robust open-source datasets of medical images are extremely rare due to the nature of medicine. Deidentifying medical images is very time intensive, and labeling the dataset requires the expertise of a medical professional, in this case a radiologist. The open-source dataset was small and imbalanced, so transfer learning and image augmentation were used to improve prediction accuracy.
