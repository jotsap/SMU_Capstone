## Cluster Analysis
  
This is an independent cluster analysis of a standard numerical (i.e. NON-image) data set created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, physician at the University Of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison, Wisconsin. These are numerical values from digital imaging technique that he developed, and thus using this as a preliminary look at the types of predictive insights that exist with traditional methods involving numerical or text data.
